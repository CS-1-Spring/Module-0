# Module-0
I'm very much looking forward to our time together Tuesday. Here are a few administrative tasks that will make our time together effective and fulfilling. 

# Before Tuesday
* Create a [GitHub account with a free plan](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/).
* [Install Git on your machine](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
* If you've never used it, [consult the Markdown syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/).

# On Tuesday
Please bring these with you.
* Bring your laptop
* Have one of your assignments for your courses handy (if you're a library, directions for research)

See you Tuesday.
